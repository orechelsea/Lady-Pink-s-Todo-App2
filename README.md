Put image here
A full-stack project built using the Django framework with; Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I aim to create a functional blog website for users to get their life organised with a todo list app.

# ABOUT
Lady Pink's Todo App is a Todo List App where users can register for an account, create a todo list, update and delete existing todo list. This website is targeted at allowing users organise their daily todo items and providing a more organised way of doing things.

# UX
--
I started with strategy, focusing on the features the target audience would enjoy and find useful.

The target audience for Lady Pink's Todo List App is:

Professionals, busy parents, students
Anyone interested in tracking the progress of their todo list
Anyone looking to simplify their lives 
Anyone looking to achieve productivity and find balance

These users will be looking for:

A clear and informative website, with intuituve navigation and seeing what the website is at first glance.
A UI/UX that is minimalistic and emphasises the content and theme.
The ability to make a user account in order to add and update their todo list.
The ability to log out and login when needed. 

Given the desire to appeal to as broad an audience as possible, UX/UI philosophy will be simple with a focus on content and painless navigation.

# USER STORIES
